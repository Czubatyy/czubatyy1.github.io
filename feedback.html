        <h6>
          I've always wished to travel and improve my English. I was
          overjoyed to learn that I would get the chance to study abroad.
          I chose HZ because it has a university that I know will adequately
          equip me for employment in the IT industry, which is where I've always
          wanted to work. It was beyond happy to understand that my life was moving to a new
          level when I got the information, that I had been admitted.</h6>
