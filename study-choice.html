        <h6>
            Since I can remember, I have interaction with technology and programming.
            After becoming a programmer and informing me about what he was doing,
            my brother's best friend, who is 12 years older than me, convinced 
            me that I would also enjoy doing it. Another of the numerous benefits
            is living abroud and learning programming in English. That is why I was 
            interested in this program when searching for studies abroud because
            I would like to work as a web developer after I graduate. The world of technology
            is currently advancing, and I am confident that my studies at HZ will equip 
            me with the necessary knowledge and abilities to advance it as well.
